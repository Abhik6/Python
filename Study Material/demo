Description:
You are given n cities, represented by an n x n matrix isConnected, where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the i-th city and j-th city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise. A province is defined as a group of cities that are directly or indirectly connected. Your task is to determine the number of provinces (groups of connected cities).

A province consists of cities that are connected directly or through a series of connections between other cities. No city outside of this group is connected to the cities within the group.



Input Parameters:

isConnected (List[List[int]]): A matrix where isConnected[i][j] = 1 means the i-th city is directly connected to the j-th city, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 means they are not.

Output:

Return the total number of provinces.



Example:

Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The first two cities are connected, and the third city forms a separate province.
 
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Each city is its own province, as there are no connections between cities. -->
